# Airline Sentiment Analysis using NLP ✈️🧠

## Project Overview:
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and classify airline-related tweets as positive, neutral, or negative. The workflow includes data preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and the development of Naïve Bayes and Random Forest Classifiers to accurately predict sentiment. This allows airlines to gain valuable insights into customer emotions, improving service quality and customer experience. 

This project provides valuable insights for airlines by analyzing customer feedback in real-time, enabling them to address issues quickly, enhance their services, and improve overall customer satisfaction. 🚀

## Features:
- **Real-Time Sentiment Classification**: Analyzes tweets related to airlines and classifies them as positive, neutral, or negative. 
- **NLP and Text Preprocessing**: Tweets are cleaned by removing mentions, hashtags, URLs, and stopwords. 
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses Naïve Bayes and Random Forest classifiers to predict sentiment. 
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualization of the sentiment analysis results using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
- **Feature Engineering**: Text data is transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF for efficient model training.
